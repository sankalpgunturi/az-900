# Describe Cloud Concepts

## Cloud Computing and Vocabulary

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a delivery model for services like:

- Storage (files, databases)
- Compute Power (Linux, Windows, Web)
- Networking
- Analytics (Performance data, Telemetry)
- and many more...
  over the internet

### What are the key characteristics of Cloud Computing

- **Scalability**: The ability to scale. It is a process of allocating and deallocating resources
  - Types of scaling:
    - Vertical Scaling: Scaling up and Scaling down (CPU Memory Storage)
    - Horizontal Scaling: Scaling in and Scaling out (Amount)
- **Elasticity**: The ability to scale dynamically.
- **Agility**: The ability to react quickly. It is the ability to allocate and deallocate (scale) resources quickly.
- **Fault Tolerance**: It is the ability to remain up and running during component and service failures.
- **Disaster Recovery**:
  - **Disaster** is a serious disruption of services caused by natural or human-induced causes.
  - **Disaster Recovery** is the ability to recover from an event that has taken down the service (disaster).
- **High Availability**:
  - $Availability$ = $\frac{Uptime}{Uptime + Downtime}$ = A measure of system uptime for users/services.
  - **High Availability** is the ability to keep services running for extended periods of time with very little downtime.

## Economies of Scale

- Cost per unit (service) lowers as the size of the company grows.

## CapEx vs OpEx

### CapEx

- Key Characteristics
  - Own Infrastructure
  - Big Initial Investment
  - Lots of maintenance required
    - Support staff
    - Power and Networking
    - Hardware Failures
    - Others

### OpEx

- Key Characteristics
  - Rent infrastructure
  - No intial investment, pay for what you use
  - Minimal Maintenance
    - Operations Team

### Comparison

| **Attributes**    | **CapEx**   | **OpEx**       |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Upfront Cost      | Significant | None           |
| Ongoing Cost      | Low         | Based on Usage |
| Tax Deduction     | Over time   | Same year      |
| Early Termination | No          | Anytime        |
| Maintenance       | Significant | Low            |
| Value over time   | Lowers      | No change      |

## Consumption-Based Model
- Key Characteristics
    - No upfront cost
    - No wasted resources
    - Pay for additional resources when needed
    - Stop paying at any time
    - Multiple pricing components per service
    - Very granular usage measurement
